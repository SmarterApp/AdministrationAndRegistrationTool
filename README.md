# AdministrationAndRegistrationTool
The assessment Administration and Registration Tool (ART) is used to administer user accounts, grant privileges, and register students for tests.

Source code to ART is presently maintained at [https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss/adminandregtools_release](https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss/adminandregtools_release). This is a placeholder repository intended primarily for the collection of issues (bug reports and enhancement requests) that will inform ART development starting in July 2015.
